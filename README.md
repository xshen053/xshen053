<!--- Hi, I’m Xiaxi Shen
- I’m currently a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering major at University of Washington.
- With a strong foundation in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, I possess a deep understanding of these fields and a fervent desire to expand my knowledge. 
- Recently, I have developed a keen interest in Infrastructure/Systems/Pipelines, recognizing their significance in the rapidly evolving world of information technology.
- Information technology is changing the world. I feel lucky to witness this amazing process as a participant.
<!-- - My ultimate goal is to work for a tech company that is at the forefront of innovation. I am actively seeking internships and networking opportunities to gain more experience in the field, and as a first step, I am trying to make contributions to the open-source community.>
- During my spare time, I like reading books, hiking, playing sports and playing the piano. I am currently taking a **tennis** course. 🎾💪
<!-- - The cherry blossoms at UW are in full bloom and it's absolutely breathtaking. I'm really enjoying the colorful scenery!
