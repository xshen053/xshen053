- Hi, I’m Xiaxi Shen
- I’m currently a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering major at University of Washington
- I’m interested in Software Design and Development, Machine Learning, Computer System, etc.
- I am particularly drawn to Machine Learning because of its potential to revolutionize many fields, from healthcare to finance.
- Information technology is changing the world. I feel lucky to witness this amazing process as a participant.
- My ultimate goal is to work for a tech company that is at the forefront of innovation. I am actively seeking internships and networking opportunities to gain more experience in the field, and as a first step, I am trying to make contributions to the open-source community.
- During my spare time, I like reading books, hiking, playing sports and playing the piano. I am currently taking a **tennis** course. 🎾💪
<!-- - The cherry blossoms at UW are in full bloom and it's absolutely breathtaking. I'm really enjoying the colorful scenery!
